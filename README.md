# Filter API

Welcome to the Filter API - a simple Java API for filtering a collection of products.

A product should have the following attributes:
- name 
- category
- price 
- onSale

## Setup
You will need to have the following set-up on your machine:
- Java 11
- Gradle

## Tasks
The following tasks need to be completed:

### Task 1 - Filter products by name:  
   Return all products where name equals a given value.  
   E.g. name = "red trainers"
   

### Task 2 - Filter products by any attribute:  
   Return all products where some attribute equals a given value.  
   E.g. category = "shoes"... onSale = true... price = 19.99


### Task 3 - Filter products by multiple attributes  
   Return all products where multiple criteria can be combined with operators  
   E.g. name = "red trainers" AND category = "shoes"
